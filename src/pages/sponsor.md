title: Corporate Sponsorships
---

Hello! If your company has derived significant value from my work, sponsorships might be a more appealing option than individual donations. A sponsorship will place a message from your company prominently near the top of all articles, for the duration of a week. In the past month, boehs.org has received <b id="viewcount"></b> views. Sponsorships are currently **$300** a week. Here is an example of what you will get:

<div style="border: 2px solid gray; border: 2px solid var(--border); padding: 10px;position: relative">
<img style="float: left; height: 70px; width: auto; padding: 0 10px 10px 0" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Acme_Markets_lolo.svg/2560px-Acme_Markets_lolo.svg.png">
ACME allows corporations to easily sponsor open source developers.<sup style="float: right">Ad</sup>
