The privacy of visitors is important. A small, self-hosted hit counter is hosted on a server in the EU that I control. Viewers are not tracked across sites, and there is no client-side state. All data collected by the counter is publicly available for transparency.

Certain facts about my life may be "fuzzed" for various reasons, including but not limited to privacy and comedic effect.

I strive to be as forthcoming as possible about the source of information, including open sourcing data, the procedure to obtain said data, and referencing used sources. Sometimes information must be censored for legal reasons and/or for the protection of living persons.

Sponsors may help fund my work. Article sponsors are a type of donation to the site. They never have any control over the content of pages or what I write about. If an article is sponsored, the only change is that there is a clearly marked advert at the top of the article. Adverts are implemented with 1st party HTML & CSS and do not contain tracking mechanisms. Links to external products may be affiliate links, however are only linked when the product would be otherwise referenced in absence of such a program. See the [sponsorship page](/sponsor) for more information.
