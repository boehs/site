# Boehs Flavoured Markdown

Boehs.org uses a pretty ugly derivative of markdown that enables a lot of special features. This is an attempt to document it. No features result in runtime javascript execution unless explicitly denoted.

## Blocks

### Code blocks

Code blocks are denoted using the standard triple backticks, with an optional language specifier: \`\`\`language. Languages specifiers enable syntax highlighting using [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/).

There are some special language specifiers that produce something other than syntax highlighting:

#### `pintora`

This will use [`Pintora.js`](https://pintorajs.vercel.app/) to render the code block as a diagram. Mermaid.js is not supported, due to a lack of [SSR](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/3650) support.

#### `js exec`

This evaluates the code block as javascript _at build time_, and displays the return value. The javascript code has access to the following variables:

-   globals:
    -   `window`: Can be used to access a virtual DOM created by `jsdom`.
-   function scoped:
    -   `d3`: The d3 library.
    -   `Plot`: The Observable Plot library.
    -   `h`: An object containing custom helper functions.
        -   `h.read`: An object containing the following functions:
            -   `h.read.csv`: Reads a CSV file.
            -   `h.read.read`: Reads a file. Makes no assumptions about the file format.
            -   `h.read.text`: Reads a text file.
